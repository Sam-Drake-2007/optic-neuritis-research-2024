# Optic Neuritis Research (2024)

This repository contains the research project **“L’effet du miconazole et de l’azathioprine sur la névrite optique”**, presented as part of the **Ottawa Science & Innovation Competition 2024**, where it reached the finals. The study explores a novel treatment approach for optic neuritis, a condition linked to multiple sclerosis, using a combination of **miconazole** and **azathioprine**.

## 📄 Abstract
Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve that leads to rapid and painful vision loss. Current treatment relies on corticosteroids, which reduce inflammation but do not address the underlying cause of demyelination, often resulting in recurrence.  

This research investigates whether combining **miconazole** (to promote remyelination by activating ERK proteins) with **azathioprine** (to suppress harmful immune responses) could provide a more effective long-term therapy. Mouse models of multiple sclerosis (EAE) were used to simulate demyelination and test treatment outcomes with imaging methods such as MRI and OCT.

**Goal:** Determine if the drug combination can regenerate myelin, reduce optic nerve inflammation, and prevent recurrence of optic neuritis.

## 🧪 Methodology (Summary)
- Subjects: 30 SJL mice (20 female, 10 male), chosen for susceptibility to EAE.  
- Procedure: Induced EAE to simulate demyelination and optic neuritis.  
- Treatment: Daily injections of **miconazole (20mg/kg)** and **azathioprine (2mg/kg)** directly into the optic nerve.  
- Evaluation: OCT (retinal scans) and MRI to monitor inflammation and remyelination.  

## 🌟 Importance
If successful, this approach could provide a pathway to new therapies not only for optic neuritis, but also for other **autoimmune demyelinating diseases** such as multiple sclerosis.
